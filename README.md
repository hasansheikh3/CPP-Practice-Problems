# CPP-Practice-Problems

## A list of common C++ Practice Problems, which I came through. 


Every Problem contains the Problem Statement, link to the Problem, and my approach to solve the problem. If any problem contains multiple efficient solutions, I have tried to write them all. Here is a [Sample Problem](https://github.com/hasansheikh3/CPP-Practice-Problems/blob/main/Practice%20Problems/max_product.cc)

This includes practice problems from sites like GeeksforGeeks, Leetcode, Hackerrank, and all over the Internet.

Please note that I am still learning, and my code might not be fully optimized, but I will try to upgrade as much as possible. Feel free to fork, or fix a bug.

For now I am mostly using Leetcode or Techiedelight (They have a good collection of problems too).
