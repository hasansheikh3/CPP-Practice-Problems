Every Problem contains the Problem Statement, link to the Problem, and my approach to solve the problem. If any problem contains multiple efficient solutions, I have tried to write them all. Here is a [Sample Problem]([https://github.com/hasansheikh3/CPP-Practice-Problems/blob/main/Practice%20Problems/max_product.cc](https://github.com/hasansheikh3/CPP-Practice-Problems/blob/main/Hashtables/roman_to_int.cc))

This includes practice problems from sites like GeeksforGeeks, Leetcode, Hackerrank, and all over the Internet.

Please note that I am still learning, and my code might not be fully optimized, but I will try to upgrade as much as possible. Feel free to fork, or fix a bug.

For now I am mostly using Leetcode or Techiedelight (They have a good collection of problems too).

## Adherence to Google's C++ Style Guide

I have tried my best to adhere to C++ Style Guide by Google. Since these are small independent files, header files are not included (but I intend to add header files, once the codebase is stable).
